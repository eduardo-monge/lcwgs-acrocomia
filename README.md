# lcWGS-Acrocomia
This repository includes all the Linux and R scripts used to produce the genomic analysis of Acrocomia species using lcWGS data. 

The general workflow included 4 steps: 
1. Pre-processing sequencing
2. Aligment
3. Genotype likelihood stimation (SNP calling)
4. Genomic strucutre analysis
5. Demografic analysis
6. Selection analysis
7. mDNA analysis

Each folder includes the corresponding scripts used in the analyses. No additional explanations or tutorials are provided; the goal is to ensure full transparency and reproducibility of the work.
