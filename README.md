# lcWGS-Acrocomia
This repository includes all the Linux and R scripts used to produce the genomic analysis of Acrocomia species using lcWGS data. 

The general workflow included 4 steps: 
1. Pre-processing sequencing
2. Aligment
3. Genotype likelihood stimation (SNP calling)
4. Genomic strucutre analysis
5. Demografic analysis
6. Selection analysis
7. mDNA analysis
