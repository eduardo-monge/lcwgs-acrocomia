# Aligment
These steps are for aligning adapter-free sequences to the reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA), as well as filtering the alignment results. They also include the calculation of total sequence coverage and percentiles for subsequent analyses.

   * [2.1. Aligment](2.1_aligment) - Using BWA-MEM
   * [2.2. Quality filters](2.2_quality_filters.sh) - Using Samtools
   * [2.3. MarkDuplicates & ClipOverlap](2.3_mark_clip.sh) - Using Pikard and BamUtil
   * [2.4. Calculated mean depth](2.4_depth.sh) - Using Samtools
   * [2.5. Computated depth and statics in R](2.5.statics.R) - Using Rstudio
