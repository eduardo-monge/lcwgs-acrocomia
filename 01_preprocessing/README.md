# Pre-processing
These steps are intended to perform the demultiplexing of the data and apply all necessary quality filters prior to sequence alignment. This includes the following steps:

   * [1.1 Demultiplex](01_preprocessing/1.1_demultiplex)
   * [1.2 Trimming](01_preprocessing/1.2_trimming)
   * [1.3 Quality filters](01_preprocessing/1.3_filter)
   * [1.4 MarkDuplicates & ClipOverlap](01_preprocessing/1.4._markduplicates_clipoverlap)
   * [1.5 Calculated overage depth](01_preprocessing/1.5._depth)
