# Pre-processing
These steps are intended to perform the demultiplexing of the data and apply all necessary quality filters prior to sequence alignment. This includes the following steps:

   * [1.1 Demultiplex](01_preprocessing/1.1_demultiplex)
   * [1.1 Demultiplex](01_preprocessing/1.2_trimming/)
   * [1.1 Demultiplex](01_preprocessing/1.3_demultiplex3/)
   * [1.1 Demultiplex](01_preprocessing/1.4._demultiplex4/)
   * [1.1 Demultiplex](01_preprocessing/1.5._demultiple5/)
